# Python-for-Everybody-Coursera

About this Specialization : This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, you’ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own  applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

There are 5 Courses in this Specialization

1. Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. It cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course covers Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. This course covers Python 3.

2. Python Data Structures
This course introduces the core data structures of the Python programming language. We move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course covers Python 3.

3. Using Python to Access Web Data
This course shows how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  We scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  We work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. This course covers Python 3.

4. Using Databases with Python
This course introduces students to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort.  The course uses SQLite3 as its database.  We also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes.  We use the D3.js library to do basic data visualization. This course covers Python 3.

5. Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
In the capstone, students build a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python.   The projects involves all the elements of the specialization.  In the first part of the capstone, students do some visualizations to become familiar with the technologies in use and then pursue their own project to visualize some other data that they have or can find. This course covers Python 3.
